    3.  Imagine that you working on online chat application. You have a model with two users, and you must to operate with next information:
        - nickname (f.e.: ‚ÄúNick‚Äù);
        - phone number (f.e.: +380 12 345 67 89)
        - account number (f.e.: 543GDR45GF);
        - activity (online/offline, boolean);

        You must create a simple program model to allows these two users to communicate with each other with known information. 
        Users must have the following abilities:
        - addUserToContacts()
        - sendMessage()
        - makeAudioCall()
        - makeVideoCall()
        - makePhoneCall()

    You need to make these functions for each of the two users (we don't know about Classes in C++ yet, sorry üòÑ).

    You have to figure out in what situations which data for functions are required as input and which as output. Also you have to figure out in what situations which data for functions are required as input and which as output. And also think about simple logic for your functions, for example, user-1 will not be able to successfully make a video call to user-2 if the user-2 is offline. 

    Or, say, user-1 wants to add user-2 to contacts. Suppose that when adding a friend, you need to enter the correct phone number, and if it matches the existing one (user-2), then user-2 will be successfully added to user-1‚Äôs contacts.
